# Loki

_This, the previous "article" (on [Grafana](./043_grafana.md)), and the next one (on [Vector](./045_vector.md)), are occurring mostly in parallel so that I can validate these services as I go._

Loki is... there's a whole lot going on there.

I enabled a retention policy so that my logs wouldn't grow without bound until the end of time. This coincided with me noticing that my `/var/log/journal` directories had gotten up to about 4GB, which led me to perform a similar change in the `journald` configuration.

I reduced the `retention_delete_worker_count` from 150 to 5 ðŸ™‚

I also configured Loki to use Consul as its ring kvstore, which involved sketching out an ACL policy and generating a token, but nothing too weird. (Assuming that it works.)
