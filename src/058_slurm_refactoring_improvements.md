# Slurm Refactoring and Improvements

## Overview

After the initial Slurm deployment (documented in chapter 032), the cluster faced performance and reliability challenges that required significant refactoring. The monolithic setup role was taking 10+ minutes to execute and had idempotency issues, while memory configuration mismatches caused node validation failures.

## Problems Identified

### Performance Issues
- **Setup Duration**: The original `goldentooth.setup_slurm` role took over 10 minutes
- **Non-idempotent**: Re-running the role would repeat expensive operations
- **Monolithic Design**: Single role handled everything from basic Slurm to complex HPC software stacks

### Node Validation Failures
- **Memory Mismatch**: karstark and lipps nodes (4GB Pi 4s) were configured with 4096MB but only had ~3797MB available
- **Invalid State**: These nodes showed as "inval" in `sinfo` output
- **Authentication Issues**: MUNGE key synchronization problems across nodes

### Configuration Management
- **Static Memory Values**: All nodes hardcoded to 4096MB regardless of actual capacity
- **Limited Flexibility**: Single configuration approach didn't account for hardware variations

## Refactoring Solution

### Modular Role Architecture
Split the monolithic role into focused components:

#### Core Components (`goldentooth.setup_slurm_core`)
- **Purpose**: Essential Slurm and MUNGE setup only
- **Duration**: Reduced from 10+ minutes to ~50 seconds
- **Scope**: Package installation, basic configuration, service management
- **Features**: MUNGE key synchronization, systemd PID file fixes

#### Specialized Modules
- **`goldentooth.setup_lmod`**: Environment module system
- **`goldentooth.setup_hpc_software`**: HPC software stack (OpenMPI, Singularity, Conda)
- **`goldentooth.setup_slurm_modules`**: Module files for installed software

### Dynamic Memory Detection

Replaced static memory configuration with dynamic detection:

```yaml
# Before: Static configuration
NodeName=DEFAULT CPUs=4 RealMemory=4096 Sockets=1 CoresPerSocket=4 ThreadsPerCore=1 State=UNKNOWN

# After: Dynamic per-node configuration
NodeName=DEFAULT CPUs=4 Sockets=1 CoresPerSocket=4 ThreadsPerCore=1 State=UNKNOWN
{% for slurm_compute_name in groups['slurm_compute'] %}
NodeName={{ slurm_compute_name }} NodeAddr={{ hostvars[slurm_compute_name].ipv4_address }} RealMemory={{ hostvars[slurm_compute_name].ansible_memtotal_mb }}
{% endfor %}
```

### Node Exclusion Strategy

For nodes with insufficient memory (karstark, lipps):
- **Inventory Update**: Removed from `slurm_compute` group
- **Service Cleanup**: Stopped and disabled slurmd/munge services
- **Package Removal**: Uninstalled Slurm packages to prevent conflicts

## Implementation Details

### MUNGE Key Synchronization

Added permanent solution to MUNGE authentication issues:

```yaml
- name: 'Synchronize MUNGE keys across cluster'
  block:
    - name: 'Retrieve MUNGE key from first controller'
      ansible.builtin.slurp:
        src: '/etc/munge/munge.key'
      register: 'controller_munge_key'
      run_once: true
      delegate_to: "{{ groups['slurm_controller'] | first }}"

    - name: 'Distribute MUNGE key to all nodes'
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        content: "{{ controller_munge_key.content | b64decode }}"
        dest: '/etc/munge/munge.key'
        owner: 'munge'
        group: 'munge'
        mode: '0400'
        backup: yes
      when: inventory_hostname != groups['slurm_controller'] | first
      notify: 'Restart MUNGE'
```

### SystemD Integration Fixes

Resolved PID file path mismatches:

```yaml
- name: 'Fix slurmctld pidfile path mismatch'
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    content: |
      [Service]
      PIDFile=/var/run/slurm/slurmctld.pid
    dest: '/etc/systemd/system/slurmctld.service.d/override.conf'
    mode: '0644'
  when: inventory_hostname in groups['slurm_controller']
  notify: 'Reload systemd and restart slurmctld'
```

### NFS Permission Resolution

Fixed directory permissions that prevented slurm user access:

```bash
# Fixed root directory permissions on NFS server
chmod 755 /mnt/usb1  # Was 700, preventing slurm user access
```

## Results

### Performance Improvements
- **Setup Time**: Reduced from 10+ minutes to ~50 seconds for core functionality
- **Idempotency**: Role can be safely re-run without expensive operations
- **Modularity**: Users can choose which components to install

### Cluster Health
- **Node Status**: 9 nodes operational and idle
- **Authentication**: MUNGE working consistently across all nodes
- **Resource Detection**: Accurate memory reporting per node

### Final Cluster State
```

```

## Future Improvements

### Monitoring Integration
- **Prometheus Exporter**: Add prometheus-slurm-exporter for job metrics
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Visualize cluster utilization and job statistics
- **Alerting**: Notify on node failures or queue backlogs

### Resource Management
- **GPU Support**: Integrate velaryon GPU node with GRES configuration
- **Storage Tiering**: Implement fast local scratch with shared NFS storage
- **Network Awareness**: Add bandwidth and connectivity constraints

### Configuration Enhancement
- **Node Classes**: Group nodes by capability (8GB Pi, 4GB Pi, GPU)
- **Workload Partitions**: Create specialized queues for different job types
- **Container Integration**: Support Singularity/Podman for containerized jobs
