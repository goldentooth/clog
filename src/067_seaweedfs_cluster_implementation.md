# SeaweedFS Cluster Implementation: Conquering Container Complexity on ARM64

Following our strategic decision to adopt SeaweedFS for ReadWriteMany storage needs, this chapter documents the detailed implementation journey from concept to production-ready cluster. What began as a straightforward deployment quickly evolved into an intensive debugging session that revealed the intricate challenges of running distributed storage systems on ARM64 hardware with tight memory constraints. The result: a robust 3-node SeaweedFS cluster delivering exactly the capabilities our hybrid storage architecture demanded.

## Implementation Strategy: Memory-First Architecture

Our SeaweedFS deployment strategy prioritized memory efficiency above all else, recognizing that our 3.7-4GB Pi nodes required aggressive resource optimization to maintain system stability.

### Node Role Distribution

We leveraged the existing "ceph" inventory group, repurposing the three nodes that previously ran our Ceph cluster:

**Fenn (Primary Node - 7.6GB RAM):**
```yaml
# Triple-duty primary node
seaweedfs-master:     1.0GB limit  # Raft leader
seaweedfs-volume:     2.0GB limit  # Enhanced data caching
seaweedfs-filer:      1.5GB limit  # POSIX filesystem interface
Total allocation:     4.5GB        # 59% of available memory
```

**Karstark & Lipps (Secondary Nodes - 3.7GB each):**
```yaml
# Distributed secondary nodes
seaweedfs-master:     512MB limit  # Raft followers
seaweedfs-volume:     1.5GB limit  # Data storage
Total allocation:     2.0GB        # 54% of available memory
```

This asymmetric distribution concentrated resource-intensive components (particularly the Filer) on our highest-memory node while maintaining cluster redundancy across all three masters and volume servers.

### Kubernetes Architecture Decisions

The deployment utilized StatefulSets for masters (requiring persistent identity) and Deployments for the single Filer instance, with careful pod anti-affinity ensuring no two masters could colocate:

```yaml
affinity:
  podAntiAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/name: seaweedfs-master
      topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values: ["fenn", "karstark", "lipps"]
```

## The Debugging Odyssey: Container Entrypoint Complexity

What should have been a straightforward deployment rapidly descended into a complex debugging journey that revealed fundamental misunderstandings about SeaweedFS container configuration.

### Phase 1: The "Help Text" Revelation

Our initial deployment attempts failed spectacularly with cryptic errors from the SeaweedFS containers. The breakthrough came from an unexpected source - examining the container's help text:

```bash
kubectl exec -it seaweedfs-master-0 -- /bin/sh
$ /usr/bin/weed master -help

# This revealed the correct flag syntax and exposed our fundamental error
```

**The Problem**: We had been mixing Kubernetes container conventions with SeaweedFS binary expectations. SeaweedFS containers expect the binary subcommand ("master", "volume", "filer") as the first argument, not as part of a complex command structure.

**Original Broken Configuration:**
```yaml
containers:
- name: seaweedfs-master
  image: chrislusf/seaweedfs:3.68
  command: ["/usr/bin/weed"]
  args: ["master", "-v=1", "-metricsAddress=0.0.0.0:9327"]
```

**Corrected Configuration:**
```yaml
containers:
- name: seaweedfs-master
  image: chrislusf/seaweedfs:3.68
  args: ["master"]  # Simple subcommand only
```

### Phase 2: Flag Validation Hell

Even after correcting the basic entrypoint issue, we encountered a cascade of invalid flag errors. Each component (master, volume, filer) has a specific set of supported flags, and we had been extrapolating configurations from different versions or components.

**Master Server Flags - What Actually Works:**
```yaml
# WRONG - These flags don't exist for masters
args: ["master", "-v=1", "-metricsAddress=0.0.0.0:9327", "-idxFolder=/data"]

# CORRECT - Minimal configuration using config file
args: ["master"]
env:
- name: GOMEMLIMIT
  value: "1073741824"  # Go GC tuning for Pi hardware
```

**Volume Server Flags - Lessons Learned:**
```yaml
# The volume server accepts different flags than master
args: ["volume", "-mserver=seaweedfs-master:9333", "-dir=/data"]
```

The key insight: SeaweedFS components are highly specialized, and flag compatibility doesn't transfer between master, volume, and filer services. Each requires careful research of its specific flag set.

### Phase 3: CSI Driver Version Archaeology

Our CSI driver deployment revealed another layer of complexity around ARM64 image availability and version compatibility.

**The Version Mismatch Crisis:**
```yaml
# FAILED - Version didn't exist for ARM64
image: chrislusf/seaweedfs-csi-driver:v1.2.9

# WORKED - After extensive Docker Hub archaeology
image: chrislusf/seaweedfs-csi-driver:v1.2.7
```

This required systematic investigation of available ARM64 images:
```bash
# Manual verification of ARM64 availability
docker manifest inspect chrislusf/seaweedfs-csi-driver:v1.2.7
docker manifest inspect chrislusf/seaweedfs-csi-driver:v1.2.9
```

The lesson: ARM64 support in container ecosystems remains inconsistent, requiring explicit verification of multi-architecture image availability.

### Phase 4: RBAC Permissions Excavation

The CSI driver demanded extensive Kubernetes permissions that weren't immediately obvious from standard CSI documentation. This required iterative debugging of permission denied errors:

**Critical RBAC Rules Discovered Through Trial and Error:**
```yaml
# Basic CSI permissions weren't enough
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["persistentvolumes", "persistentvolumeclaims"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "delete", "patch"]

# Required additional permissions for ARM64 Pi cluster
- apiGroups: ["storage.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["csistoragecapacities"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]

# ARM64 Kubernetes required these for proper CSI operation
- apiGroups: ["csi.storage.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["csinodeinfos"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

Each permission was discovered through systematic analysis of CSI controller pod logs and progressive permission additions.

### Phase 5: Environment Variable Completeness

The final debugging phase involved discovering missing environment variables that the CSI driver required but weren't documented in basic deployment guides:

**Missing Variables That Broke CSI Controller:**
```yaml
env:
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: spec.nodeName
- name: NAMESPACE
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: metadata.namespace
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: metadata.name
```

Without these variables, the CSI controller couldn't properly register with Kubernetes or identify its operational context.

## Production Configuration: The Final Architecture

After resolving all debugging challenges, our production SeaweedFS configuration achieved elegant simplicity:

### Master Server Configuration

        env:
        - name: GOMEMLIMIT
          value: "1073741824"  # 1GB memory limit for Go GC
        - name: GOMAXPROCS
          value: "2"           # Pi CPU constraint
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

  args: ["volume", "-mserver=seaweedfs-master:9333", "-dir=/data"]
  env:
  - name: GOMEMLIMIT
    value: "2147483648"  # 2GB on fenn, 1.5GB on others
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "800Mi"
    limits:
      memory: "2Gi"      # Varies by node
```

- name: seaweedfs-filer
  image: chrislusf/seaweedfs:3.68
  args: ["filer", "-master=seaweedfs-master:9333"]
  env:

    value: "1610612736"  # 1.5GB limit
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "800Mi"
    limits:
      memory: "1500Mi"
```

### CSI Driver Success Configuration

  - --nodeid=$(NODE_ID)
  - --cacheCapacityMB=128
  - --cacheDir=/tmp
  - --v=5
  env:
  - name: NODE_NAME
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: spec.nodeName
  - name: NAMESPACE
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.namespace
  - name: POD_NAME
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.name
```
