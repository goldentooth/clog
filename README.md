# Clog (Changelog)

Basically just a journal of me working through creating and configuring and doing a bunch of stuff with my [Pi Bramble](https://goldentooth.net).

This isn't really as much a blog as it is just a series of notes to myself of what I've done, what I left undone, what I struggled with, etc. I would be delighted if it is of some use to other engineers or hobbyists. I don't know how likely that is, though.

## AI Warning

I've written some recent chapters with the assistance of Claude Code. I'm not terribly proud of that, especially since this is one of the weightier artifacts representing my actual hobbies. While these chapters are missing a human touch and have the sort of "design-by-committee" feel that all Generative AI products have, I do think they're more comprehensive and better at recording details than I would've been. I try to clean up the slop where I notice it, but it's possible some utter crap has slipped through. If you see something too shitty, just mention it to me and I'll scrape it off.
